      <description>Abstract Network connectivity discovery is an extensively studied area, and there are many interesting mechanisms such as ping, traceroute, DNS, address resolution protocol (ARP), and SNMP available to discover network elements and the connectivity among them. Traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

      <title>Turbocharging Python for Data Science with Numba</title>
      <link>https://vidyasrimani.github.io/writings/numba-for-data-science/</link>

      <guid>https://vidyasrimani.github.io/writings/numba-for-data-science/</guid>
      <description>Preview Turbocharging Python for Data Science with Numba Python is powerful for data science, but it can struggle with heavy computations. Numba, an open-source JIT compiler, accelerates Python code by converting it into efficient machine code with minimal effort. By simply adding a decorator, Numba can significantly boost performance, making it ideal for numerical computations, custom algorithms, and real-time data processing, all while maintaining Python&amp;rsquo;s ease of use.
In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to use Numba with data science.</description>
