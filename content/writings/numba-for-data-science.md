## Turbocharging Python for Data Science with Numba

Python is powerful for data science, but it can struggle with heavy computations. Numba, an open-source JIT compiler, accelerates Python code by converting it into efficient machine code with minimal effort. By simply adding a decorator, Numba can significantly boost performance, making it ideal for numerical computations, custom algorithms, and real-time data processing, all while maintaining Python's ease of use.

In this article, you’ll learn how to use Numba with data science.

Let’s dive in!
